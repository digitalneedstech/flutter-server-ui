# Flutter Server Driven UI

This project contains code to render UI in Flutter by getting the response from server in JSON format.


## Documentation

There are two pages in this project.
1. Home page - which renders form content from JSON format.

2. Second page- renders ui with support to render different kinds of widgets like container, row, text etc.


I have kept two dummy jsons in
src/shared/assets/constants.dart.
Which can be considered as a response from any api.
